            "I grew up gay in Montego Bay. That sentence is simple. Living it was not. I learned to read rooms before I learned to read books. I learned what to hide, who to become, how to make myself small enough to survive a place that did not have space for what I was.",

            "When Aaron and I decided to end our marriage, we did not follow the script. No lawyers in separate rooms. No weaponized silence. We sat across from each other with a therapist and we said the things married people are not supposed to say out loud. We called it the pressure cooker method. It was brutal. It was clarifying. And when it was over, we were still friends. I did not expect that.",

            "I wrote a memoir about my divorce and then I scored it with original music. The writing part took years. The singing part nearly broke me. Both required the same thing: sitting with something uncomfortable long enough to find the shape of it, and then handing it to a stranger.",

            "My second book is a thriller set in Jamaica. A disinherited nurse. Colonial law. A revenge plot that unfolds over twelve months. People ask how I jumped from memoir to crime fiction. I tell them I have always been interested in what people do when they run out of acceptable options.",

            "I study developmental and behavioral psychology. I have participated in ayahuasca ceremonies and psilocybin-assisted sessions. I have sat in lecture halls and in sweat lodges. I do not rank these experiences. They are all part of the same question: how do people change, and what does it cost them?",
