            "A psychiatric nurse in training and a seeker by nature, Mathew's journey from the beaches of Jamaica to the therapy rooms of Florida reads like a masterclass in intentional transformation. Growing up gay in Montego Bay taught him early that survival sometimes means performing, but his work now centers on the radical act of showing up authentically—especially when it's uncomfortable.",

            'His approach to life\'s most difficult moments is refreshingly unconventional. When his marriage to Aaron began to unravel, rather than following the traditional script of bitter divorce proceedings, they chose what Mathew calls a "pressure cooker" method—confronting pain head-on, with therapeutic support, to transform heartbreak into something resembling wisdom. The result wasn\'t just the preservation of their friendship, but a blueprint for how love can evolve when we stop trying to control its form.',

            "Mathew's memoir, A Novel Divorce, chronicles this journey with the precision of someone trained to observe human behavior and the vulnerability of someone willing to dissect his own. He writes about psilocybin ceremonies in Costa Rican jungles with the same unflinching honesty he brings to examining his failures as a partner, his struggles with anxiety, and his gradual learning to love without the armor of performance.",

            "His academic interests in developmental and behavioral psychology and alternative therapeutic modalities aren't abstract pursuits but lived experiments in understanding how people change, heal, and grow. He's as likely to reference Brené Brown's research on vulnerability as he is to describe the practical effects of ayahuasca on trauma processing, approaching both with the curiosity of someone for whom transformation is a daily practice.",

His writing, whether memoir or fiction, carries the hard-won wisdom of someone who learned that the stories we tell ourselves can either trap us or set us free, and that sometimes the most radical thing we can do is tell the truth about who we've been in service of who we're becoming.",
