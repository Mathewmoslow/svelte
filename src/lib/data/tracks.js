            "This was the first song that came out of me during the divorce. I was trying to make sense of why we were tearing apart something that didn't feel broken—just wrong-shaped, maybe? Neither of us wanted to lose each other completely, but we both knew we couldn't stay married. We were figuring out how to keep all the good stuff, all the reasons we fell for each other in the first place, while letting go of this thing that was suffocating us both."

            "I was scrolling through Instagram and came across a post that absolutely struck me—like being hit sideways, and I guess that's what happened to the guy who originally posted it. I took his words and reimagined them somewhat, then spent about 24 hours straight writing and reworking the music, trying to sing and understand a genre I was completely unfamiliar with. But it had to sound like this. I was crazed, and this is the result."

            "This started as a poem to my dog Amber, then evolved. I contemplated not including it because I knew it would make Aaron cry those happy tears that wish things had been different—nostalgia. But things are great, and we will always have the memories, and we will always have Costa Rica. This song is a cheeky nod to aging gracefully and has a hidden commentary only Aaron will pick up on regarding photos and maybe the sheer number of them."

            "This was inspired by women who are badass and go through divorce, raise kids, keep their heads up, but still long for their man. It's for the late-night booty callers, the ones who don't delete his number from their phone, the strong, confident, independent ones who still want someone to rub their back and tell them they're doing a good job. It was actually written originally to be an Evanescence-Nicki Minaj mashup and turned into this jam-rock track."
