Others, I had to drag them out, bloody and reluctant. But slowly, the story of who I actually was began to emerge from beneath decades of careful construction.",

            "Music became another language for things I could not quite capture in prose. Late nights in makeshift studios, learning to sing my own pain, discovering that auto-tune cannot fix what is broken but it can help you find your voice anyway. Each song became a chapter I could not write any other way.",
