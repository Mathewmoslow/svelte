I was sitting in my kitchen, coffee growing cold, when I understood that the performance I'd been giving for years wasn't sustainable anymore.",

            "Writing became my laboratory. Each morning, I'd sit with my laptop and excavate another layer of truth. Some days, the words flowed like confession. Others, I had to drag them out, bloody and reluctant. But slowly, the story of who I really was began to emerge from beneath decades of careful construction.",

Late nights in makeshift studios, learning to sing my own pain, discovering that auto-tune can't fix a broken heart but it can help you find your voice anyway. Each song became a chapter I couldn't write any other way.",
