The beginning of this story isn't the heartbreak, or the honeymoon, or even the aftermath of the orgy that became pure panic. This story begins in Montego Bay, Jamaica, where a boy learns to perform to survive. Until his performance becomes his identity and that identity becomes a prison, trapping him in a marriage that wasn't meant to be. But he had been playing the role so long he'd forgotten there was ever a person beneath the costume.
What unfolds across these pages is not a guide to getting over the end of a relationship. It's one man's retelling of the coming apart and the putting back together. From ayahuasca ceremonies in jungle sweat lodges to nights spent prowling hookup apps, from barstools to breakdowns during naked yoga, he maps the clumsy beginning of his second life and the strange cast of characters who help him shape it.
A Novel Divorce will take you through therapy, through emotional torment, through a hundred hard conversations and a few soft ones, to the discovery of a new kind of love for Mathew. A Novel Love. Self love.
This book is not a performance.
 There will be no encore.
 There will be no curtain call.
By stripping himself down to the studs, Moslow shows us that walking away can be an act of love. That staying isn't the only measure of commitment. And that the person you become after the end might just be the one you were supposed to be all along.
