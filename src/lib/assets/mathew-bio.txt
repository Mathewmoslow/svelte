I write about the things most people only whisper about in therapy.

I am a psychiatric nurse in training, a Jamaican who grew up gay in Montego Bay, and a man who dissolved his marriage on purpose. Not out of spite. Out of love. The kind of love that looks nothing like what you were taught it should.

Growing up where I did, I learned early how to perform. How to read a room, adjust, survive. I got good at it. Too good. I spent years constructing a version of myself that was palatable, presentable, safe. And then I married Aaron, moved to Florida, and watched the whole construction buckle under the weight of its own dishonesty.

When the marriage started coming apart, we did something most people thought was insane. We sat in it. Together. With a therapist. We called it the pressure cooker method because that is exactly what it felt like. No one escapes a pressure cooker unscathed, but what came out the other side was a friendship neither of us expected and a clarity I could not have bought at any price.

I wrote about all of it. The psilocybin ceremonies in Costa Rica. The hookup apps. The naked yoga. The 3 AM arguments and the mornings after when the coffee tasted like apology. That became "A Novel Divorce," a memoir that I also scored with original music because apparently I do not know when to stop.

My second book, "Beyond The Reach Of Justice," is a thriller about a disinherited Jamaican nurse who turns to crime. People ask how I went from memoir to thriller. I tell them the distance between vulnerability and violence is shorter than you think.

I study developmental and behavioral psychology. I have sat in ayahuasca ceremonies and I have sat in lecture halls, and I approach both with the same posture: leaned forward, notebook open, willing to be changed by what I find.

I live in Florida now with my dog Amber. She is my easy answer to the question everyone asks about joy. The honest answer is longer, uglier, and still being written.
